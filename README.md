This repo houses the assets used to build the Weather Dashboard! webpage, available at  
https://enanesh.github.io/weather-dashboard-js/

Developed in JVS,HTML and CSS code lenguages. Using Jquery and \ bootsrap libraries. 

As a traveler I create this weather outlook for multiple cities so I can plan a trip accordingly.




1)This webpage handles user inputs to search for the current and future weather condiditions.
<br>
2)After step 1 you are going to be presented with current weather conditions for  your input city (Temperature,humidity,wind speed).
<br>
3)Under the current day a 5-Day Forecast is going to be displayed using the same parameters(Temperature,humidity,wind speed)
<br>
